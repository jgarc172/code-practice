# Basic Types and Value Creation
## Basic Value Types
The coding exercises will be based on the three most common fundamental value types in the programming languages used in the 
exercises: 

* boolean
* numerical (integer)
* string (characters)

## Literals as Creating Values of Basic Types
All programming languages provide a syntax to **create** or **produce** values of a given type.  For the three basic types in our exercises, the syntax looks very similar in most programming languages.  For illustration purposes (and as described later) we can use the notation `->` to indicate "produces" or "is equivalent to"

For example in Java, the digits `10` produce the value 10 of type int:

```java
10 -> int
```

Here are more examples of literals of the three basic types in their respective programming languages:

### Java Literals

```java
boolean:
  true  -> boolean
  false -> boolean

int:
  5   -> int
  0   -> int
 -20  -> int

String:
  "a"     -> String
  "hello" -> String
  ""      -> String
```

### Go Literals

```go
bool:
  true  -> bool
  false -> bool

int:
  5   -> int
  0   -> int
 -20  -> int

string:
  "a"     -> string
  "hello" -> string
  ""      -> string
```

### Python Literals

```javascript
bool:
  true  -> bool
  false -> bool

int:
  5   -> int
  0   -> int
 -20  -> int

str:
  "a"     -> str
  "hello" -> str
  ""      -> str
```

### JavaScript Literals

```javascript
boolean:
  true  -> boolean
  false -> boolean

number:
  5   -> number
  0   -> number
 -20  -> number

string:
  "a"     -> string
  "hello" -> string
  ""      -> string
```
