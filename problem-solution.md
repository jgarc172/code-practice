# Goal
I would like to learn computer programming in any language by using a gradual progression of code practices, where each practice builds from the previous practices.  

I feel that the coursework I took in college presented many concepts that were useful in my current knowledge of programming.  However, the concepts presented were not in a clear gradual progression.  This caused me a lot of confusion.  Now I would like for someone to tell me that "natural" progression of concepts needed for one to learn, or teach others, computer programming.

# Translated Goal:
For someone to learn, there has to be someone to teach, and the tools must be made available to the student to provide the optimal practice experience.

# Problem and Solution Statement
There is an optimal set of code practice problems that encourage learning in a gradual, but non-discouraging, progression.  There is also a minimum set of tools that the student can use to implement and run code solutions to the code practice problems that focus on the concepts and remove concepts that are distracting.

Translated Solution Statement:
1. Learning new information is the presentation of a change--of something new. 
2. The changes then are given in a gradual progression of new practice problems with new concepts that have a relationship with concepts of the previous practice problems.
3. There are fundamental concepts that are immediately presented in the first set of code practices.  These concepts will always have a relationship to future practice problems, but as they are learned early, they are less distracting.
