# Goal
I would like to learn computer programming in any language by using a gradual progression of code practices, where each practice builds from the previous practices.  

I feel that the coursework I took in college presented many concepts that were useful in my current knowledge of programming.  However, the concepts presented were not in a clear gradual progression.  This caused me a lot of confusion.  Now I would like for someone to tell me that "natural" progression of concepts needed for one to learn, or teach others, computer programming.

# Translated Goal:
For someone to learn, there has to be someone to teach, and the tools must be made available to the student to provide the optimal practice experience.

# Problem and Solution Statement
There is a set of code practice problems that encourage learning in a gradual, but non-discouraging, progression.  Thee is also a set of tools to present the student with code practice problems that focus on the concepts and remove concepts that are distracting.

Translated Solution Statement:
1. Learning new information requires the presentation of a change--of something new. 
2. The changes then have to be in a gradual progression of new practice problems with new concepts that have a relationship with concepts of the previous practice problems.
3. There have to be fundamental concepts to be presented in the first set of code practices.  These concepts will always have a relationship to future practice problems.
