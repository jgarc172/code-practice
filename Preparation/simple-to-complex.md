Our approach to solving programming problems is by learning how to deal with the simplest problems and continue with more difficult ones.  Therefore, we will also need to become familiar first with the simple data value types in programming before dealing with more complex and structured data types.

## Basic Value Types 
The coding exercises will be based on the three most common fundamental value types in the programming languages used in the 
exercises: 

* boolean
* numerical (integer)
* string (characters)

## Literals as Creating Values of Basic Types
All programming languages provide a syntax to **create** or **produce** values of a given type.  For the three basic types in our exercises, the syntax looks very similar in most programming languages.  For illustration purposes (and as described later) we can use the notation `->` to indicate "produces"

For example in Java, the digits `10` **produce** the value 10 of type integer:

```java
10 -> int
```
