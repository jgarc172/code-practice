# Function Signature of Built-in Operators and Control Structures

To take advantage and to make proper use of built-in operators and control structures, it helps to understand their inherent 
function signature.

## Built-in Operators
Here is a list of some of the common built-in operators in the programming languages used in the exercises:

```
boolean operators and their function signature: 

!  : boolean -> boolean
&& : boolean, boolean -> boolean
|| : boolean, boolean -> boolean

integer operators and their function signature:

+ : integer, integer -> integer
- : integer, integer -> integer
* : integer, integer -> integer

string: 

integer comparison operators and their function signature:

== : integer, integer -> boolean
>  : integer, integer -> boolean
<  : integer, integer -> boolean
>= : integer, integer -> boolean
<= : integer, integer -> boolean
```

## Control Structures
Here is a list of some of the common control structures and their function signatures:

```
if  : boolean -> execution
for : integer, boolean -> repeat execution
```

## Literals
Literals are not necessarily the application of a function, but it helps to see what their function signature is:

```
boolean: 
  true  -> boolean
  false -> boolean

integer: 
  10  -> integer
  -45 -> integer
  
string:
  "a"     -> string
  "hello" -> string
```
