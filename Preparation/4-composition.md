# Composition as Problem Solving

To solve any problem, small or large, it is important that we understand the smallest components of a problem and its 
respective solution.

Programming languages already give us those small and fundamental (**primitive**) elements.  We already introduced the *three
basic value types* and some of the *built-in* operators.  In addition to those, we have to include the use of **literals** to 
produce such element values.
