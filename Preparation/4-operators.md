# Function Signature of Built-in Operators and Control Structures

To take advantage and to make proper use of built-in operators and control structures, it helps to understand their inherent 
function signature.

## Built-in Operators
Here is a list of some of the common built-in operators in the programming languages used in the exercises:

```
boolean operators and their function signature: 

!  : boolean -> boolean
&& : boolean, boolean -> boolean
|| : boolean, boolean -> boolean

integer operators and their function signature:

+ : integer, integer -> integer
- : integer, integer -> integer
* : integer, integer -> integer

string: 
```

## Control Structures
Here is a list of some of the common control structures and their function signatures:

```
if  : boolean -> execution
for : integer, boolean -> repeat execution
```
