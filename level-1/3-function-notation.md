# Problem

Define a notation for the function signature that will be used in the exercises.  

## Solution
The following notation will be used for all the exercises and will be translated to their respective programming language:

```
name of function: type1, type2, ... -> returned type
```

## Example
Define a function isPositive that takes an integer and returns a boolean

```
isPositive: integer -> boolean
```

## Java
In Java, the method signature will look like this:

```java
boolean isPositive(int num){
}
```

## Go
In Go, the function signature will look like this:

```go
func isPositive(num int) bool {
}
```

# Python
In Python, the function signature will look like this with a comment to document the intended signature:

```python
def isPositive(num):
    # int -> bool
```

# JavaScript
In JavaScript, the function signature will look like this with a comment to document the intended signature:

```javascript runnable
function isPositive(num){
    // number -> boolean
}
```
